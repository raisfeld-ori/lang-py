# lang-py
lang py is a free python 
module for parsing
and compiling python code. 
the goal of the module is to 
assist in creating 
python compilers that
compile into other languages. 
also, unlike regular 
compilers, lang-py is an 
actual package that can be imported, 
so it's possible to directly
interfere with the compiler 
at any point, and do
things like additional optimization 
or fixing bugs.
also, the module
has both automatic,
and primitive methods
for everything.
so you can decide how 
deep you want to 
personally handle
the compilation, and
how much do you want to
leave to us.
also, most of the automatic
functions are async
with no GIL, so they are
much faster then
normal python functions.
